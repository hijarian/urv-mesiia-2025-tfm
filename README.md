Core files:

1. [thesis.tex](./thesis.tex) - the article itself in LaTeX
2. [library.bib](./library.bib) - biblatex bibliography for the article
3. [thesis.pdf](./thesis.pdf) - current latest render of the thesis.tex, I try to keep them in sync in this repo but it's not guaranteed.

Everything else is not that important than the above files.
